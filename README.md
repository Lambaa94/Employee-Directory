## Description
This project allowed me to get a good base understanding of React. What this application does is a front end application that holds a list of employees. You are able to search your employees by their name and sort them by their name and email. I came across some obstacles with this project where I found it difficult to figure out how to sort items on a table but after understanding react made it easy to perform tasks. Reacts layout makes the developers expierence a lot more streamlined.
